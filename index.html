      <p>
        Hello! I am Freda Tuffour. And I am from Kumasi, Ghana. 
        I enjoy cooking both local and continental dishes, researching, 
        listening to music and dancing. I am currently pursuing software 
        development at BYUPathway, Idaho. I am extremely happy to acquire knowledge 
        and skills in software development. I am looking forward to 
        becoming an ardent developer and work in companies like the Amazon, 
        Google and among others. I am very excited to what is ahead of me. 🚀

        Ghana, officially the Republic of Ghana, is a country in West 
        Africa known for its democratic governance, rich cultural 
        heritage, and diverse geography including tropical rainforests 
        and coastal savannas. The country is rich in natural resources 
        and is a leading producer of cocoa and gold. With its capital in 
        Accra, Ghana is a significant regional player, noted for its 
        history as the first Black African nation south of the Sahara to gain 
        independence from colonial rule in 1957.
